        <b>HyperText</b> <i>Markup Language</i> commonly referred to as HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
        It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.
        <u>The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</u>

<h2><i>History</i></h2>
    <p>
        <em>In 1980</em>, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
        In 1989, <strong>Berners-Lee</strong> wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[2]
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
        That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
        In his personal notes<sub>[3]</sub> from 1990 he listed<sup>[4]</sup> "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

<h3>Drink 'Till She's Cute</h3>

        <pre>
        <b>A man stopped at his favorite watering
        hole after a hard days work to relax.
        He noticed a man next to him ordered a shot
        and a beer. The man drank the shot, chased
        it with the beer and then looked into his
        shirt pocket. This continued several times
        before the man's curiosity got the best of
        him. He leaned over to the guy and said,
        "Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice your
        little ritual, why in the world do you look
        into your shirt pocket every time you drink
        your shot & beer"? The man replied, "There's
        a picture of my wife in there, and when she
        starts lookin' good, I'm headin' home"!</b></pre>
